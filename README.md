# CS-250-Programming-Languages

Programmed in C++, this project uses if loops to create a clock which displays time in 12 and 24-hour formatting. 
Enter the menu to adjust the time by the minute, hour, or second. 


While building this project, I learned a valuable technique and skill, research, and implementing concepts through forums and instructions found online. 
I found this project challenging because it was the first program, (more than small statments) that I wrote from scratch. 
I ran into many errors and gained a better understanding of loops. 
I could enhance this project by correcting an issue in format. When minutes, hours, or seconds is greater than 9, the frame around the clock is offset. 
The top skills I enhanced while building this program would be debugging, creating loops, and designing a clear output of data. 
By creating a display menu, I made this progam easily adaptable to different time zones by the user input.
