Incorporating C++ and Java

Programmed in C++, this project uses if loops to create a clock which displays time in 12 and 24-hour formatting. 
Enter the menu to adjust the time by the minute, hour, or second. 

Known problems:
- does not display time in 01:05 formatting
- when hours or minutes are greater than 9, astericks are out of place.
